Miscellaneous Scripts
=====================

Assorted scripts, usually stand alone ones which do not justify having
their own projects.

Licensing details will be in each script, some will be GPL and some
will be BSD.  Some might even be WTFNMFPL.  If a script does not state
which license or licenses it is released under then it is released
under the modified BSD license I use.
